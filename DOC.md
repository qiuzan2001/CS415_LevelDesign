I think the most challenging part of this MP is to get started. It sounds really basic now, but when I just start to work on it, every sigle operation is a big problem such as making a new level, use the provided model...
For part 1, add a health system is easy. Most of contents of this part are provided, and we were very familiar with health system from last project helps a lot as well.
For part 2, the pursuer is the hardest. But I got a lot fun from watch them having funny BUGs or behaves unormal, such as never see me even if I stand in front of it. For the mortar, it caused a lot of time since I need to find out everything by myself. And I don't have any idea about my own enemy. Of course, I want to make something cool, like a big BOSS that I need to kill. But it's way beyond my level, so I just followed my teammates sugguestion: make an easy minefield(please don't take points of for unpassionate!).
Other than that, I think this project made me more familiar with UE4. And I'm kind of understand why UE is the greatest engine now, it just so powerful and made C++ coding way more intuitive.
